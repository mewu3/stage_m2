rule splitFiles:
    input: /datater/wu/data/msa/zika.msa
    output: /datater/wu/data/zika/split_forward/position_{*}.fasta (dynamic)
    jobid: 3
    wildcards: sample=zika

Subsequent jobs will be added dynamically depending on the output of this job

rule merge_all_kmers:
    output: /datater/wu/data/zika/primer3_Tm/all_oligo
    jobid: 9
    wildcards: sample=zika

Terminating processes on user request, this might take some time.
