Error in rule merge_all_kmers:
    jobid: 9
    output: /datater/wu/data/filtering/zika/forward/all_oligo.tsv
    shell:
        cat /datater/wu/data/filtering/zika/forward >> /datater/wu/data/filtering/zika/forward/all_oligo.tsv
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job merge_all_kmers since they might be corrupted:
/datater/wu/data/filtering/zika/forward/all_oligo.tsv
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
