Error in rule mafft:
    jobid: 0
    output: test/sequences_aligned.fasta
    log: test/mafft.log (check log file(s) for error message)
    shell:
        mafft --auto         --clustalout on         --tm PAM200/k=2         test/sequences.fasta > test/sequences_aligned.fasta         2> test/mafft.log
        (one of the commands exited with non-zero exit code; note that snakemake uses bash strict mode!)

Removing output files of failed job mafft since they might be corrupted:
test/sequences_aligned.fasta
Shutting down, this might take some time.
Exiting because a job execution failed. Look above for error message
